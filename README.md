Airline reservation system and password encryption

This project will build a progeam that allow public users to do follwing tasks:
1. create account with username and password, and login their account
2. user information will be stored into Persons array as Person class 
2.1 password will be stored and ecrypted in database.
3. select date, departure/destination airport to search // a search will generate list of flight from hardcode array or database
3.1 if round trip select return date.
4. user could choose a flight from list.
5. user could select their seat(s) that has not been taken.
6. 


take reservations for airline and booking seat. The user can enter a person’s name, passport number, phone, how many days return and assign them to a designated seat. The system should prevent two different people from booking the same seat. 
Tips: Think of this in terms of classes and arrays. For the airline example, a plane can be thought of as an array of seats. This array can be an array of Person classes. You would store the person’s name and other attributes within the Person class and then store that in the array at the designated seat. If an array slot is empty, no one has booked the seat.
